# Natural Language Processing for Text Classification with NLTK and Scikit-learn
I you are aware of the basics of tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, chunking, and named entity recognition; furthermore,  text classification using a simple support vector classifier and a dataset of positive and negative movie reviews, then in this tutorial, we will expand on this foundation and explore different ways to improve our text classification results. We will cover and use:
Regular Expressions
Feature Engineering
Multiple scikit-learn Classifiers
Ensemble Methods
